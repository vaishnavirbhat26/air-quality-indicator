# Air-Ouality-Indicator
It is a simple Javascript website to show the weather forecast and air quality index of the given co-ordinates. At first, it automatically detcts the present location and gives its details. 
The project was implemented keeping in mind the software engineering principles. We have followed an Agile methodology.
